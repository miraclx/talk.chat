# TALK.CHAT

> TCP Chat server built on pure NodeJS.
> Source code for a software talk that didn't hold.
> Had to finish writing the code üòÅ

## Installing

From source:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/miraclx/talk.chat.git
```

## Usage

``` bash
cd talk.chat
node server.js
```

## Connection

You can use anything that can keep a TCP connection

``` bash
$ nc localhost 8888
What is your name? 
```

## Features

### Auto root
By default, starting the server automatically logs in the `root` user.
Right there, the process's I/O is linked to the chat server. This user has administrative powers. You can also logout here to login elsewhere.

### Direct private messages

To send direct messages, reference the user like so
```
@michael Hello
```

### Personal Messages

To save personal messages, send a `direct message` to yourself

### Administrator elevation

Admin users can perform certain operations not granted to other users
```
.makeadmin [user]
.revokeadmin [user]
```
Absence of explicit stating of `user` would automatically infer to carry out the operation on the user executing the command

## Commands

* `.exit`: Alias for .logout
* `.help`: Alias for .commands
